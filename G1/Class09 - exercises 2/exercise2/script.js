/*

Write a JavaScript program called PhoneBook. 
You should have three input fields in the html,
one for firstName, lastName and phoneNumber.
After entering the values into each of them,
on clicking on a “Save” button, you should
display the newly added contact in a table
below the inputs. Make sure the user is entering
an appropriate values in the fields!

Bonus: Add column with delete and edit button
so that you can edit or delete a contact! Try
to save the newly added contact as an object
(literal or constructor function its up to you)
and add it to an array!
